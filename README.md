 ReBot is a discord bot that provides a message menu option to report messages to server moderators.
<br><br>
 To set up the bot, simply invite it to your server and then create a private channel with the name #rebot-reports.
<br>
 Server members will be able to report messages by right-clicking a message, clicking "Apps", and then clicking "Report to server mods". The report will be sent in the #rebot-reports channel where moderators will be able to mute/kick/ban the user.
